Hello,

For a while I have been playing around with different website builders. I tried Wordpress and found the free themes not so customizable and the speed not great. I tried Wix which is really easy to use but a little expensive and very slow. 
I decided that to build a fast site that looks exactly like I want I need to learn HTML and css. Learning those languages wasn’t so hard. I used w3schools website and YouTube tutorials and really started getting the hang of things.  The problem is that I find it very tedious writing all that code.  Furthermore, I find design difficult which means that I need templates to really get going.
I was looking to a solution to get around writing all that code and came across HTML templates. There are beautiful free Html5 templates. I downloaded a couple and played around with them. My experience was bad. Making changes makes everything goes wrong. If you change a picture the size gets all messed up. If you want the text to be a little different then it sits wrong. Then you have to open up the css files and dig around and try to fix everything. I found that to be really annoying.
I want a framework that has 4 elements:
1. Free.
2. Templates that I can edit.
3. Creates very fast sites.
4. Has a system to add content without making changes to the original files.

After digging around I came across an article on <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/">Makeuseof.com</a> (check it out it’s a great website).
The article was about static site generators. This seemed to be the answer to all my problems.
So I downloaded ruby, installed Jekyll and followed all the complex but clear instructions on the Jekyll site. Finally, I had a site. I was expecting something much more elaborate and colorful but that's okay because there are themes, right? 
I went to one of the links on the Jekyll website and picked out a nice theme. I followed instructions and tried to install it to no avail. I didn’t realize that there are Gem based themes and non gem based themes. All the tutorials discuss gem based themes. I didn't understand why there was no documentation that I could understand for non gem themes.
So I tried to install a gem based theme. Finally getting it to work I didn’t understand how to make it mine. How to make changes to the theme. How to add posts and pages. How to add photos and videos. All the documentation and tutorials didn’t help me. Some were very basic like how to get Jekyll up and running and some were way too complicated for me.
I was really considering giving up Jekyll because it was so complicated. I like easy and simple, clean and smooth.
The speed of the sites pulled me back and  I figured if so many people use it then I could do it too. I decided that I will do what it takes to learn Jekyll. 
This site is my journey to learning Jekyll. Here goes...
