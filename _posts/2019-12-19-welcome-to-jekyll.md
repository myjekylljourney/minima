When building a website you usually have an idea of how you would like it to look. When starting with the Jekyll default theme; minima I imagine many people get put off. There are no beautiful pictures, no color, nothing eye catching. 

Have no fear, there are many nice themes that can be used with Jekyll. 

To learn how Jekyll works we will start with the default theme. A simple theme like minima is very good for learning how the system works. After learning how to use Jekyll integrating a fancy theme will be much easier.
