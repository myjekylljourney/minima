title: How to Start

There are a few ways to start with Jekyll. I am going to explain the way that I found the easiest.

<i>What we are going to do is create a GitHub account and fork the minima repository to our account. 
That way we will have all the files and folders we need without downloading and uploading anything.</i>

- Go to GitHub.com and create an account. The instructions on the GitHub website are very clear. 
(Once you create an account GitHub will tell you to create a repository. There is no need to do that.)

 - Go to the GitHub search bar at the top and search (all GitHub) for <i>minima</i>.
The first result that will show up is <i>jekyll/minima</i>, click on it. 
At the top right of the minima page you will see a button that says fork. 
GitHub will now copy all the files from the minima repository to your account. 

Congratulations! You have a website!
So where is it?
- On the bar at the top open up settings. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Change the source to <i>master branch</i>. 
The page will automatically refresh. Scroll back down to the top of the GitHub Pages section. 
It should say <i>Your site is ready to be published at:</i>
If you go to that URL you will see your new site. 
(It can take a few minutes for the site to be up. So keep on refreshing your browser till you see it.)
